EpiCenter was developed by [Health Monitoring Systems (HMS)](http://www.hmsinc.com), former employees of the University of Pittsburgh, as a replacement to the the [Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System (RODS)](http://openrods.sf.net).  EpiCenter was designed to be functionally equivalent to the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System.

RODS is licensed under the Affero GPL license and initially HMS promoted EpiCenter as an open source project--first under the Apache license and the subsequently under a dual LGPL license.  HMS suddenly close sourced EpiCenter in August of 2008--references to EpiCenter as an open source project disappeared from their website.

The University of Pittsburgh kept complete copies of the HMS code repositories and developer notes throughout its development--recognizing that EpiCenter was a derivative of the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance System.

The University of Pittsburgh makes the last available version of the open source code for EpiCenter available here to benefit the public health community. The University continues to notify HMS of their obligation to update the code located here.

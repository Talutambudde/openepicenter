Quick note for building on JDK6:
--------------------------------

JDK6 includes JAXB-RI 2.0.3, and EpiCenter is using 2.1.6.  This will
cause the build to fail on JDK6 until I come up with a workaround for Maven.

The easiest fix is to copy jaxb-api-2.1.jar into your $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed directory.
